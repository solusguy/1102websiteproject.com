  <h1 class="color"align="center"> 5 COMPUTING DISCIPLINES AND MAJORS </h1> 
 
   <p class="color"> <b>COMPUTER SCIENCE</b></p>
   <p class="color">Computer Science is the discipline study of computers and computation using the scientific method.
    Computing science (CS) spans the range from theory through programming to cutting-edge development of computing solutions. Computer science offers a foundation that permits graduates to adapt to new technologies and new ideas.

   <p class="color"><b>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</b></p>
   <p class="color">Computer engineering is solidly grounded in the theories and principles of computing, mathematics, science, and engineering and it applies these theories and principles to solve technical problems through the design of computing hardware, software, networks, and processes.
    Computer engineering is a branch of computer science and electrical engineering. This field of study combines several disciplines to design and develop software and hardware systems. 
    Computer Engineering is about understanding how computer systems work and how they integrate with other systems that surround us.

   <p class="color"><b>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</b></p> 
   <p class="color">IT focuses on meeting the needs of users within an organizational and societal context performing selection, creation, application, integration, and administration for computing technologies.
    Information technology is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of data and information. 
    Information technology is also a branch of computer science, which can be defined as the overall study of procedure, structure, and the processing of various types of data. 
     The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.

    <p class="color"><b>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</b></p>
    <p class="color">Information systems is an academic discipline of the complementary networks of hardware, software, users and business processes that organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and distribute data. Any specific information system aims to support planning, operations, management and decision making.
      An information system is a formal, sociotechnical, organizational system designed to collect, process, store, and distribute information.
      Information systems can be defined as an integration of components for collection, storage and processing of data of which the data is used to provide information, contribute to knowledge as well as digital products that facilitate decision making.
      </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="color"><b>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</b></p>
    <p class="color">Software engineering is an engineering-based approach to software development. 
      Engineering techniques are used to inform the software development process, which involves the definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself.
