    <p class="color"><b>NUMBER SYSTEMS</b></p>
    <p class="color">Number systems are systems in mathematics that are used to express numbers in various forms and are understood by computers. A number is a mathematical value used for counting and measuring objects, and for performing arithmetic calculations.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="color"><b>DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM</b></p>
    <p class="color">A number system with a base value of 10 is termed a Decimal number system. It uses 10 digits i.e.  0-9 for the creation of numbers. Here, each digit in the number is at a specific place with a place value of a product of different powers of 10.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="color"><b>BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM</b></p>
    <p class="color">A number System with a base value of 2 is termed a Binary number system. It uses 2 digits i.e. 0 and 1 for the creation of numbers. The numbers formed using these two digits are termed Binary Numbers.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="color"><b>OCTAL NUMBER SYSTEM</b></p>
    <p class="color"> The octal Number System is one in which the base value is 8. It uses 8 digits i.e. 0-7 for the creation of Octal Numbers. Octal Numbers can be converted to Decimal values by multiplying each digit with the place value and then adding the result.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="color"><b>HEXADECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM</b></p>
    <p class="color">A number System with a base value of 16 is known as Hexadecimal Number System. It uses 16 digits for the creation of its numbers. Digits from 0-9 are taken like the digits in the decimal number system but the digits from 10-15 are represented as A-F i.e. 10 is represented as A, 11 as B, 12 as C, 13 as D, 14 as E, and 15 as F.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="color"><b>USES/SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH NUMBERS SYSTEM</b></p>
    <p class="color">Decimal number system - Is used in computer programming</p>
    <p class="color">Binary number system - The binary number system is very useful in electronic devices and computer systems because it can be easily performed using just two states ON and OFF i.e. 0 and 1.</p>
    <p class="color">Octal number system - It is widely used in computer application sectors and digital numbering systems.</p>
    <p class="color">Hexadecimal number system - Hexadecimal Numbers are useful for handling memory address locations.</p>
